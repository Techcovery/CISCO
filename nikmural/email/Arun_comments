you have extensively identified  features and  implemented multiple models including ensembles. While identifying featues you have selected Tfidfvectoriser.
the tfidvectoriser willnot capture semantic information. We will discuss this in the upcoming class by using wordtovec and bi directional lstm based vectorisers.
You may be able to get better results by using LSTMs and GRUs which will also be discussed in the subsequent classes.

For what is know at this point you have done an extensive analysis
