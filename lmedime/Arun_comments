Comments for Sales_predict

You have attempted to solve this problem using Multi linear regression, Polynomial regression and have transformed features using PCA.
Before we start transforming features it would be a good idea to try feature elemination by looking at correlation matrix.
In this case a correlation graph would have clearly reduced features and may have resulted in feature baggging.
you can also use hyper parameter search techniques like grid search or bayesian inferencing to identify the right degress for polynomial regression
