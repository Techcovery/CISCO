You have attempted to slove this problem using polynomial regession and linear regression. 
The first step in solving these problems is to identifying right set of features. You may want to consider the correlation map of featues and perform
feature engineering techniques like PCA. 
You may choose hyper parameter for polynomial regression (degree) using grid search or bayesian search
Feature selection is the critical part in any
regession problem.
