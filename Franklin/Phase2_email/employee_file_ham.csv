642,"Subject: king ranch
there are two fields of gas that i am having difficulty with in the unify
system .
1 . cage ranch - since there is no processing agreement that accomodates this
gas on king ranch , it is my understanding hpl is selling the liquids and
king ranch is re - delivering to stratton . it is also my understanding that
there is a . 05 cent fee
to deliver this gas . we need a method to accomodate the volume flow on hpl
at meter 415 and 9643 . this gas
will not be reflected on trans . usage ticket # 123395 and # 95394 since it is
not being nominated from a processing agreement . we either , need to input
a point nom ( on hpl or krgp ) at these meters to match the nom at meter 9610 ,
or a deal for purchase and sale ( if king ranch is taking title to the gas )
needs to be input into sitara at these meters with the appropriate rate . i
have currently input a point nom on krgp to accomodate this flow , so we can
divert some of this gas to the current interstate sales that are being made .
2 . forest oil - there is a processing agreement that will accomodate flow
from the meter ( 6396 ) into king ranch . it is my
understanding that this agreement was originally setup until texaco had
their own processing agreement . i need confirmation that the gas from this
meter should be nominated on contract # ( 96006681 ) and that this agreement
should have been reassigned to hplc . ( it is currently still under hplr ) .
if this gas is not nominated on the above transport agreement , then once
again we need to accomodate the flow volume on the hpl pipe with either a
point nom or a sitara deal at meters 415 and 9643 .",ham

the finalization process , but to learn from each other relative to your
respective areas and allow the newcomers to get up to speed on the account as
well . i would encourage everyone to attend these meetings initially as i

sorry i ' m just now getting back to you . here are some answers to your
questions .
waskom is a field in east texas ( harrison county ) where we purchase gas from
pennzenergy at the bryson c . p . and jeter # 2 wells . the gas is termed up to
new
waskom gas gathering ( nwgg ) through june 2001 ( the term of the pennzenergy
purchase ) . we then buy the gas back from nwgg into our tetco east texas pool
. . . also termed up through 6 / 01 .
virginia field used to be associated with ngpl , but several years ago
pennzenergy worked out a processing arrangement with corpus christi gas
gathering , so the gas is now termed up with ccgm through 6 / 01 . . . priced off
of
the houston ship channel .
jennings ranch used to flow into ngpl through a gathering line , but a couple
of
years ago ngpl sold that line to midcon texas , so we now handle it as another
midcon texas property . sometimes we sell it at the meter to midcon texas
( kn ) ,
and sometimes we ship it through midcon to our ngpl south texas pool .
carthage : altra picks up their gas in their cartwheel agreement . the
agreement we nominate on is also a cartwheel agreement . it is not much
different than a hub agreement , except it allows title tracking . tgt on the
whiteboard refers to texas gas . . . east ohio takes their gas into texas gas on
a couple of different transport contracts .
let me know if you have more questions .

lee ,
i need you to answer a few questions to resolve this issue .
first , you show a deal volume of 20 , 000 on nov . 7 and the pipeline confirmed
this volume . is this the volume you agreed to sell beaumont methanol ? this
volume is in agreement what the deal ticket says , the volume confirmed by
hpl , and dorcheus ' s volume .
second , the buyback issue is that a buyback is set up until june 2000 per
julie meyers notes she sends out every month ( last note sent dec 3 and you
are on distribution list ) . brandywine has nothing to do with this issue . it
is an issue between hpl and beaumont methanol .
do we have an active buyback in place and how do you decide to use the
buyback ?
this is a commercial issue that i need further clarification from you if you
have a buyback in place or not . if not , please notify julie and note on the
deal ticket that this buyback is no longer effective .
if it is still active , please contact chyral and resolve .
let me know the final resolution .

hey joe ,
here ' s the response i got with regards to tomcat . i ' ve place another call
into david and let him know that the information we received included most
points except for tomcat . i ' ll keep you informed .
what i know is that the gas is sourced at mi 587 and moved on km ' s firm
contract . for as long as ces remembers , they sell the gas to entex . entex
chooses the pipe off which they take - - usually midcon - - also , hpl channel , or
tejas . km is invoiced directly . volume is approx . 2395 . the deal with entex
is written up monthly . km pays on a basket of indices . entex pays on the
highest index .

713 / 853 - 9272
here goes . . .
1 . i know tennessee , hpl , and tejas are at the tailgate of the plant , and i
suspect midcon texas is there as well .
2 . i ' ll fax you a copy of the nomination form that steve locke uses for agua
dulce and carthage . . . those are the only ones in texas that we nominate .
3 . the tejas plant as well as all of the other gulf energy receipt points
from
pennzenergy are exclusively tejas / gulf energy points , and it takes transport
charges to move the gas through gulf energy to interconnects , such as
thompsonville . the jennings plant does have a split connect with delhi , but
operationally pennzenergy much prefers to flow into gulf energy ( lower
pressure
= higher volumes ) .
4 . mustang island 759 for january is again 1 , 903 mmbtu / d , which peoples will
pick up at the wellhead . mustang island 785 is 4 , 100 / d , which leaves 2 , 200 / d
available to sell assuming we continue to transport 1 , 895 / d to fgt / tivoli for
peoples . our it agreement on nng is # 78581 to move gas from the wellhead to
onshore .
5 . the tomcat gas has been sold to entex into midcon texas for so long that i
don ' t think maria even talks to them anymore each month . tammi provides them
with the volume when she does the deal each month . but we can certainly
provide an entex contact if the gas is sold to them again in january .
6 . there isn ' t a waskom nomination form . the trader for this gas , mike
landolt , talks to ben britten ( president of new waskom gas gathering and
waskom
gas marketing ) .
7 . you must be referring to the page of offshore avails that begins with
sabine pass 13 . the 6 columns that appear blacked out read as follows : pvr ,
pvr , avail , dbq , dbq , and remainder .
8 . the koch - gathered volumes behind the carthage plant for 1 / 00 are 12 , 443
mmbtu / d .

round 2 :
1 . the 15 , 000 @ carthage for koch is an estimate of what we anticipate we
will
want to sell into koch . . . and it shows up on the koch whiteboard as a supply
( from carthage ) . during bidweek the traders will decide how much they
actually
want to show going to koch , and how much will be labeled base and swing . mike
landolt has been our sole koch trader and he typically takes some carthage gas
into koch , but i wouldn ' t say a particular volume is termed - up .
2 . other than very rarely shippling the jennings ranch volume over to ngpl ,
we ' ve always sold all of the midcon texas volumes to the affiliate . . .
currently done one month at a time . john hymel has been the trader for these
volumes .
3 . the entex sale @ tomcat has always been gas daily because that is the way
kerr - mcgee prices the supply . . . and entex has taken all the swings . the
january volume is 2 , 312 / d .

howard - the above meter indicates a daily swing with no one in volume
management ' s initials in oss . i need some information for daren before it
can be determined if a deal should be set up to cover the 089 contract for
11 / 97 forward .
i ' ve done some research as follows :
1 / 95 shows delivery on transport contract # 012 - 82269 - 02 - 002 ( southeastern
marketing co . as counterparty )
1 / 96 thru 10 / 31 / 97 shows delivery on transport contract # 012 - 27182 - 02 - 001
( esperanza marketing corp as counterparty ) .
11 / 97 thru 12 / 97 shows delivery on 089 - 41500 - 102
1 / 98 shows delivery on 089 - 41500 - 101
no other transactions at this meter since 1 / 98 .
some questions i need answered are - why was volume allocated to transport
contracts through 10 / 31 / 97 and then started to be allocated to the 089
contract later ? are the transport contracts no longer valid to allocate to
and is that the reason the 089 contract was used ? or should the transport
contract be allocated to instead of the 089 contract for 11 / 97 forward ? each
item indicates a delivered volume , so either a transport or sale is taking
place .
all the information that is supplied on the ua 4 report is need a contract for
9 , 448 mmbtu .
since the meter was assigned to someone else during this timeframe before it
was assigned to me , it ' s difficult to know why the 089 contract was ever used
for allocation and since there are no other records such as deal tickets in
cpr or oss .

it looks like your missing paths revealed a quirk in our suppression of zero
paths . there were 4 paths initially entered as zero , then changed to
non - zero on a later date . the system did not correctly determine that the
zero path should no longer be suppressed .
we have fixed the 4 paths affected and have corrected the code so this won ' t
happen any more . below is a screen print of the nov 22 problem that is now
fixed .

it is my understanding the outages valero incurred at the above locations are
force majure situations during december and should not trigger the buyback
feature of the contract .
gary , i have not seen any documentation of this from valero . please follow up
with your counterpart to secure the letter of notice or we will need to

george ,
gary called me about this shut in situation a few minutes ago , specifically
regarding meter 6722 . this meter is at the tailgate of three rivers ,
therefore , an hpl field employee will not be able to contact the producer
( they probably have no idea where the gas is coming from that goes through
this meter ) .
gary suggested that the deal maker contact these producers verbally , and then
connie sutton will follow up with written notice . per our discussion , since
mary jo and gary are out this afternoon , i am forwarding this message to you .
the concerned contracts are : cody texas , lp , 012 - 64365 - 101 , 96018049 and

713,"Subject: unresolved issues for jan 1 .
i think everyone agrees that there was a lot of confusion in desk assignments
and responsibilities . with that said , i am listing some of the current
issues that i have seen , that will need to be addressed quickly . most of
these issues are none of my business , but since i see unpathed gas i thought
you two might want to dicsuss these issues .
enron field services - has not been nominated since september 99 . have we
stopped doing business on this pipe ? ( just an fyi - ? ) do we need to get
this assigned ? i can find old
notes and try to get this pathed if necessary . someone just needs to let
me know .
lavaca expense transport - this is offsystem gas that hplc transports for
ena . ena has no nom at meter 1000 in pops for jan 1 .
midcon texas pipeline - there were deals left unpathed for jan 1 ( and
dec ? ) . i brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10 , 000 with
transport contract to move this gas on and no sale to broker to . as it
stands , it looks like we have a long position . who is this assigned to ? i
thought carlos was handling this one , but i could be wrong .
channel industries pipeline - several issues here :
1 . all deals with the exception of the long term transport expense were left
unpathed for jan 1 . i viewed prior month transactions and pathed
appropriately . someone
needs to review for accuracy . also , there were deals that went to zero ,
that were nominated for january .
2 . we still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement . this
issue has been left unsresolved since october 99 . volume management cannot
allocate was is
not pathed and nominated .
3 . there is a transaction for january that is once again not on our point
specific transport contracts . ( rec mtr 1 - 6366 10 , 000 to del mtr 2 - 6203
10 , 000 ) . this is a pathed pipeline . we have no rate . we need to know the
rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this
transaction , we are not legally covered . carlos was handling this pipe in
dec . who is this assigned to for jan ?
hpl operational - this shipper on hpl has been left unpathed for december
and january 1 . who is this assigned to ? this can wait until we get back
next week . if it is left unresolved , i will get it pathed when i return .
pat - the following was my recollection of the assignments for dec 1 to
the present . you might want to confirm with mary smith and then you can
proceed with decisions that need to be made based on possible unassigned
issues .
hank eisenhours duties were split :
mandey - handle all long term hplc expense issues : undeveloped contracts ,
december flow forward and cleanup of 1999 unresolved issues .
carlos - all offsystem transactions for ena and hplc in unify and all
offsystem paper and electronic noms on intrastate pipes . ami and stacey
also handle some . there is a lot of confusion here . i found unpathed gas
for december . we ' ll need to address this one quickly .
hpl transports were all split by zone . each logistics rep is responsible for
pathing all meters in their assigned zones in unify .
hpl operational seems to be left unassigned .
i think most of the desk assumed that carlos took over hanks
responsibilities . the assignments above are my recollection only .",ham

beginning this week , we are actively testing the changes to path manager to

like to have a limited group of schedulers from each desk go thru a quick
walkthru / training of the new features sometime early next week . this should
only take about 30 minutes . once they are comfortable with the features and
performance , and once the testing is complete , we would like to migrate this

an adequate adjustment period prior to the next bid week .
once it is migrated to production , we can either roll it out to all

susan ,
hope you had a great new year and holiday season ! i have a couple of issues
i want ot clear up for this year ' s contract .
the question is how valero wants to treat the three meter locations where you
are currently pulling gas . our new contract that was just sent to you has a
minimum take of 60 , 000 mmbtu ( estimated 35 , 000 @ 8018 celanese , 15 , 000 @ 1233
texas city , and 10 , 000 @ 1394 dodge street ) . if you undertake at any meter
excess volumes from another meter would be used to fulfill the entire 60 , 000
mmbtu . my accountant has told me that this is causing difficulties with the
two plants and how they want to see gas purchases broken out . we discussed
this on the phone and i got your consent to split these invoices . now we are
being told all three invoices need to be separate . since we always aim to
please the customer , here is my recommendation for handling the contract
through it ' s term . please let me know if this is fine .
celanese 35 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
35 , 000 hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid
two days after flow
texas city 15 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
15 , 000 hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid
two days after flow
dodge street 10 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
10 , 000 hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid

deal # 125836 we have been purchasing gas from cox exploration on pg & e

agreement terminated 11 / 30 / 99 . i didn ' t path the gas on pgeh , however , i

be a valid flow issue for kim vaughn . the plant continued to confirm this
gas .
we have tried working through the pipeline , but they state that they will not
know anything until the 15 th . can you contact the producer and ask them to
reverify this with the pipeline ? i would like kim to be able to zero confirm
and send back to pops so volume management will not allocate up to the
producer level .
also i just realized that we have a committed reserve purchase agreement at
the same meter with tribo production . should there have been an expected
volume in this deal ? is it possible that cox exploration sold their interest

the marketing ( sitara ) function back to your side of the fence i think a
strong case could be made in favor of that idea .
it is obvious that several people are involved in changing tickets , pathing ,
nominating , and confirming the industrials . this dissipates the knowledge
base and the responsibility factor . it is a "" who ' s on first "" issue .
if the responsibility to ensure pricing , volume , and accomplishment of market
intent is accurately depicted , and in sitara , is in your shop then the
schedulers could concentrate on the accuracy and correctness of unify and
pops . i ' m sure this would help volume management and client services
immensely .
as the skill level rises in this area you could then gradually feed more and
more of the marketing function ( sitara ) to the scheduling group in the hopes
they would then have a better understanding of the overhaul picture .
i believe the current situation is too much , too fast , for scheduling to
handle all at once . it has also created a situation where robert seems to
think not only that he has all the segments mastered , but that he is the only
person that should be involved in the industrials .
i will support whatever direction you want to go on this issue , but if you
and pat leave things the way they are please explain to both robert and pat
that others may be involved in the industrial activity and that is quite
alright .
once again , thanks for listening .

revision - according to measurement , there is flow of 7 , 394 in 8 / 98 , however ,
there is nothing to indicate this is gas that was received on hpl in oss . i
checked mips and there is a measurement statement that supports the flow rate
of 7 , 394 mmbtu .
daren is there a deal in cpr which may not have fed over to oss ? i checked
oss for the whole year of 1998 and there are no other deals in oss . it does
seem strange that this is the only month of flow .

i have had several requests from the ena business groups . now that the
agreement has been finalized , for report lists from your key applications ,
those
being , altra gms and risk works ( there may be others as people become more

ect sold 34 , 000 mmbtu to panenergy at meter 4045 for 2 / 99 . i ' ve verified w /
rebekah seales and she has determined that ect did sell this gas to
panenergy . therefore , we need to show a delivery at this meter for panenergy
or whomever panenergy is selling this gas to at this point in pops . i need a
delivery at this meter in order for this meter to balanced .
please take a look at this . call me if you have questions

anita :
i did some additional research regarding the sale to panenergy at meter 4045
on 2 / 27 and 2 / 28 . this sale was a brokered deal .
date purchase volume sale
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 phillips gas mkt . ( # 55397 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 superior natural gas ( # 57065 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu
ect did not transport this gas away from meter 4045 . if this gas was
transported away from meter 4045 , it would have been a transaction between
panenergy marketing ( or whomever they sold the gas to at that point ) and
hpl . hope this information helps .

it is the pipelines decision on how to allocate between the shippers ,
however , if the pipeline allocates the shortage to ena then we need to follow
the contract language and bill accordingly . just remember that we allowed
makeup on the 18 , 19 , & 20 th for a total volume of 5 k over 3 days so that
will apply toward the 4 th and part of the 9 th . all other volumes should be
purchased back per the language in the contract . remember they have a
tolerance of 5 % below the nomination .

allocations , and they will require explanations each month as all variances

things to consider :
project sally - allocate to gas network development
project hurricane - allocate to ? ? ? ? - ( i have a call into jim coffey )

this memo is regarding the 91 , 297 mmbtu imbalance that was created in april

transport contract # 012 - 41991 - 02 - 004 . the transport delivery off hplc was
shorted to keep
entex whole on a minimum purchase from ena . originally this transport
imbalance was to be cleared
the next month in may of 1999 . some of the imbalance was cleared in may of
1999 , but 91 , 297 mmbtu
still remains as a imbalance on this contract . we need to monitor the ifhsc
index for the upcoming months
so that when one is compatible with the ifhsc index of april of 1999 we can
clear this imbalance . we will
need to allocated 91 , 297 mmbtu extra to the transport . this will reduce the
purchase from ena by 91 , 297
mmbtu for that month . i need you to watch over whoever is doing the reliant
energy - entex allocation to
make sure this happens .

subject : carthage plant imbalance
i ' ve discussed the carthage plant imbalance with chad cass at duke energy
( carthage plant operator ) and willie shannon at devon energy and here is what
i ' ve learned . duke and devon met last fall to discuss the imbalance , which
according to devon was approximately 240 , 000 due to duke at 8 / 31 / 99 . devon
acknowledged that an imbalance existed but didn ' t think it was that high .
both
parties seemed to take the position that the other side needed to prove them
wrong . according to duke the imbalance grew by 120 , 000 in september , 16 , 000
in
october , and another 12 , 000 in november ( all round numbers ) bringing the total
to approximately 395 , 000 through the end of november . based on current month
estimates , duke thinks january sales are 1 , 000 - 2 , 000 / day higher than
production , and would like to see a cut in sales of 4 , 000 / day effective friday
1 / 21 / 00 in order to balance for the month of january . again devon disagrees
with this daily overage , based on their production estimates , but since they
recognize an imbalance exists , willie @ devon has agreed to reduce the volume
available for sale by 4 , 000 / day effective friday the 21 st . this will reduce
the amount of "" excess "" gas ( gas daily - priced ) that enron has available to sell
at carthage .
additionally , beginning february lst duke requests payback to the plant of
5 , 000 / day , continuing until the imbalance is worked off . devon should reduce
their lst of the month availabe volume by 5 , 000 / d to accomplish this , and
enron
needs to verify if that reduction is factored into the numbers when they are
setting up february activity .
a key point to this imbalance issue , and one that i believe all of the parties
agree on , is that ces , now enron , purchases devon ' s carthage gas at the
tailgate of the plant , so any production - related imbalance is between devon
and
the plant ( duke ) and make - up volumes only reduce what enron receives from
devon . enron is not buying the gas from devon and turning around and paying
back a historical imbalance . however , since ces ( and now enron ) is set up as
devon ' s agent at carthage , duke communicates the imbalance information and
coordinates make - up arrangements with enron . enron in turn needs to verify
with devon that devon has adjusted their available volumes to reflect any
make - up . hopefully once actual make - up commences , devon and duke will strive
to reconcile to an actual imbalance that they both agree on .
please call me if you have any questions @ ( 713 ) 693 - 2581 .

subject : project hurricane / bridgeline status
here is a quick status and list of to do ' s related to setting up the new j . v .
between enron & texaco which will be combining the lrc and bridgeline
pipeline systems :
summary : the lrc & bridgeline pipeline systems will be combined under the
name of bridgeline llc . ownership in the jv will be split 60 % texaco & 40 %
enron . bridgeline gas marketing llc will be the entity that will be trading
on the pipelines under the new j . v . contracts and service agreements are in
the process of being drafted .
enron will be providing the trading and commercial operations systems to
support this j . v . texaco will be providing the scada system . i understand
that accounting is still being discussed . the trading , risk , & perhaps
scheduling personnel for this jv will be initially relocated to the 21 st
floor of the enron building and will eventually move to probably the 3 allen
center once a more permanent spot can be built out . trading for the new jv
will start in early february for march production .
to do ' s :
accounting : i ' ve asked jim coffey to set up two work orders to capture it
transition and ongoing costs . texaco is also trying to set up a meeting next
monday to step through the accounting flow so that we are all on the same
page and make sure there is nothing that will fall through the cracks .
pc ' s : jim fussell is in the process of ordering the pc ' s for this jv at my
request . i will need the work order numbers to track these costs .
networks : i ' m coordinating with arshak and his team to make sure that the
voice and data networks are in place for eb 21 . once the more permanent spot
is nailed down we will then need to do the same for that location . a
combination of trader phones , lucent phones , stenfons and amtels have been
requested .
location on eb 21 : i ' m waiting on a call back from chris larson from
facilities to find out what locations on 21 will be assigned to the new jv .
currently half of the floor is empty but they are set up with high wall
cubes . there may need to be some build out for the traders to low wall
cubes . we can ' t set up the pc ' s , phones , amtels , etc until this is done .
data conversion : i have requested from texaco the contract , deal and
meter / facility information we will need to set up in our systems to begin
trading for march production . it may be possible to get an electronic dump
of this data from texaco if enron defines the data fields that we will need .
we also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios . i will also need
to know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up the
system security . i have received the names of the traders but i don ' t know
who else will need access .
interface between enron ' s unify pop ' s application and bridgeline ' s scada
application : i ' ve asked dave nommensen from enron to get with carryn wright
from texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the two
applications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface .
there will also need to be a transition plan put in place where lrc ' s
rtu ' s / efm is redirected to the bridgeline scada system . in the meantime
there will be two scada systems and perhaps two gas controls until everything
is merged into one . this will probably mean some manual interfaces between
pop ' s and scada for confirmed noms and efm volumes until the transition is
complete .
scada communications : currently the lrc rtu ' s / efm communicate back to
enron ' s scada system via leased lines . bridgelines rtu ' s communicate back to
them via a microwave system . the new jv could save on communications costs
by switching lrc ' s rtu communication to the microwave . perhaps this is best
done as a part of the scada transition .
accounting data needed by texaco for royalty purposes : this data needs to be
better defined . i will follow up with john ledoux from texaco to get this
process started .
hourly volumes : bridgeline currently has one utility customer who may be
billed on an hourly basis depending on the amount of swing . we need to talk
through this process to see what enhancements may be needed . at least
initially there will need to be some manual processes in place to support the
billing for this one customer .
please let me know if you ' d like to meet on any of these topics . i can have
my assistant set up the meeting if needed . in the mean time i can be reached
at 713 - 853 - 6858 . thanks ! - tommy",ham

my contact at beaumont methanol asked me to tell everybody in our shop the
following : to clarify whom to contact about the nomination and scheduling
for beaumont methanol at meter # 1428 .
first some background : we feed beaumont methanol through a meter station
that we own and control , but which also feeds brandywine / dupont . in fact ,
the gas goes through a dupont pipeline header downstream of our meter station
before it gets to beamont methanol . sometimes we are doing business with
both beaumont methanol and brandywine / dupont . . . . . but sometime we only do
business with one of them .
whom to call for any nominations and scheduling issues for beaumont methanol :
bob dorcheus - brandywine / dupont - 281 - 293 - 1789
chyral hankins - beaumont methanol ( terra ) - 712 - 233 - 6558
please do not call the beaumont methanol control room at the plant with
regard to scheduling and nomination issues . they are out of the loop on
these issues . if we call the beaumont methanol control room at the plant
with regard to scheduling and nominations issues , it will cause confusion of
the type we had yesterday and today .
obviously , it is of course ok for hpl gas control to call the beaumont
methanol plant control room on any emergency operational issues .

just a quick note to follow up on ua 4 issues .
for desk to desk deals , we are keeping the entry on co 89 since there is not
a co 16 contract with co 16 and attaching an ect transport contract to the
backscreen .
on park and ride deals , i am under the impression that the park and ride deal
would be booked to an 089 contract and cleared either intra month or in a
subsequent month .
if this is true , was it done by reversing out or offsetting the previous co
89 entry . i am not sure whether an ect transport should be attached . i hope
you have some insight on this issue .

864,"Subject: organization announcement
enron purchases billions of dollars of products through its wholly owned
subsidiaries and venture companies worldwide . historically , the company has
conducted these purchases in a highly fragmented , decentralized manner
allowing each of the operating units the discretion to source their
requirements in a manner that optimizes unit performance . today , however ,
with the implementation of sap and the profound explosion in
internet / intranet - based technologies , we believe the company should change
its direction and focus on aggregating its demand for goods and strategically
sourcing these requirements on a global basis . we believe that there are
significant cash savings to be extracted by the company and also commercial
potential for the formation of a highly profitable , business - to - business
e - commerce venture .
effective february 1 , 2000 , enron will form a new global strategic sourcing
unit . this new unit will consolidate the current successful strategic
sourcing initiatives underway in the gas pipeline group , global asset
operations and enron corp . initially , global strategic sourcing will focus
on aggregating enron  , s internal , joint venture and business partner demand
for products and services with the objective of creating a future
business - to - business e - commerce venture .
it gives us great pleasure to announce that george wasaff , managing director ,
will lead this new global initiative . george will report directly to mike
mcconnell , chief executive officer for global technology .
george has been with enron for fourteen years and has held many senior
executive positions , the most recent of which was managing director of enron
south america ' s wholesale operations . george was also the interim chief
executive officer of elektro from july 1998 through june 1999 and chief
executive officer of transportadora de gas del sur s . a . ( "" tgs "" ) from june
1995 through february 1998 . george has also held numerous commercial
positions including vice president and country manager , mexico for enron
international and vice president of marketing for transwestern pipeline

george in his new role with the company .",ham

subject : buyer vs . seller on intercompany deals
it has been brought to my attention that sap will not use the buyer as the
governing value associated with intercompany deals but the seller .
currently , sitara captures the volume bridged back on the buy side not the
sales side . i wanted to make sure that those of you who would be impacted by
the change were aware of how sitara would reflected the volumes associated
with intercompany deals . if there are any concerns with this , please let me
know as soon as possible . i will need to have an adjustment made to the
volume feedback reconciliation report to reflect this change once it has been
finalized . it may be a month or two before this is implemented but i wanted
to make sure everyone had advance notice .

891,"Subject: some after thoughts to our meeting
hi daren ,
i enjoyed our lunch together yesterday and believe we made a good beginning .
you have very high standards for your own performance and are highly
committed to the best outcome in all situations . you are likely to have high
expectations for results from our coaching meetings this a good formula for
success and i will do my best to honor your strengths with a focus on moving
the action forward . with this in mind , i had some thoughts and additional
questions for reflection following the meeting that i would like to share .
you are in a transition from being a high team performer to becoming the
leader of a high performing team . one of your frustrations as leader is
that members of your team seem to rely too much on you to solve problems
that arise in the day to day operations of the team . at first you responded
to their requests for help by solving it for them , then you shifted to using
questioning techniques to have them solve the problem with you . you have
also offered some training to address the learnings needed to be more
independent problem solvers . you are frustrated when some members of the
team continue to come to you with questions they should be able to solve and
when they fail to implement changes that you have trained them to use . you
are seeking ways for the the team to have the same problem solving ability
that they come to you for . you have recruited people with this ability and
you seek to expand it in the team .
this issue was the focus of our first session and needs to be the focus our
next meeting . the question is : how to engage the team in solving this
problem . how do i get the members of this team to own this responsibility
and begin creating their own solutions ? what resources are needed by each
person to contribute more to this problem ? how do i involve the team members
more in the solving of this problem ? what new behaviors do i need to employ
to increase the involvement of the team ? what do i need to change in myself
or my relationship to the people in order to engage them more actively in
the problem ?
there is one dimension that i am clear about . i know that you have used
performance appraisals to give feedback . have you put this issue before the
team as a whole for the team to solve or have you tried to change individual
team members ?
i look forward to our meeting on the 17 th . keep growing !

sorry that i haven ' t followed up yet , but we are in the middle of

together .
what i have at
present is a report from our scada system that must be run manually each day ,
to get a report of
yesterday ' s volumes , beginning and ending at 7 : 00 a . m . the problem is , until
i
can revise it , the
report shows all of our city gate volumes for all suppliers , and i need to
create a new one with only the
hpl stations . i also want to set it up for automatic creation , to run at
approx . 8 : 00 a . m . daily . it would
then be available to you for viewing via some type of bulletin board , such as
is
currently being operated
by george perrine . i will be coordinating this effort with george in that
regard . until i have completed the
entire task , however , i will try to send you a daily ( 5 days per week ) report
created manually , showing the
previous day ' s volumes for our monitored hpl stations . i am shooting for
starting this tomorrow .
i have also been discussing this with royal edmondson of our gas supply
dept . , and he wants us all
to meet to discuss coordinating our efforts and sharing all information
between
all interested parties . he

george ,
there seems to be a problem with mips while trying to actualize
the january 2000 data ( y 2 k related ) . in order to actualize jan
pops has to manually load the actual files into pops , the
side effect of this is that some of the feb data may be loaded
with numbers that are old . this will be rectified as we complete
loading the jan actuals and then load the most recent mips
measured prelim numbers for feb .
pops is currently processing the mips files in the order they
were received , we should be done with this today . please inform
us of any abnormalities that you see tommorrow .

as you might already know we had to reschedule our second meeting that was
scheduled for wednesday 2 / 16 to tuesday 2 / 22 in room 3013 . lunch will be
provided . i apologize and will avoid rescheduling our meetings in the future .
i was encouraged by the excellent dialogue and contribution at our first
meeting and believe we have the right group together to make the changes we
know are needed in our work hours .
here is the list of items we agreed to cover at the next meeting :
schedulers were going to touch base with their pipeline reps and other
contacts on the different schedules they are using and document and discuss
at the next meeting .
each manager was going to discuss with their group what would work best for
their desk and present this to the group at our next meeting
bob was going to gather information on external 12 hour schedules and follow
up with hr on schedules being used at enron
the following is what i heard at the first meeting :
our first item should be to establish a weekend and holiday schedule that
would more or less guarantee ( other than maybe an occasional call ) you have
the weekend off . cross - training seemed to be the key here . some desks seemed
to doubt this could be accomplished with current staffing levels .
cross - training is not an easy thing to accomplish and takes a "" just do it ""
attitude .
there doesn ' t have to be an across the board solution for logistics . however
all solutions we come up with will need to be formally documented so it will
be easy to move to other alternatives as the business needs of each desk
changes .
late daily hours are a reality and at some desks tied directly to traders
willingness to do deals at any time . as we get a better handle on what other
companies are doing we might be able to find something that will help address
this . everyone is realistic about the exceptions such as bid - week etc . and
really have no problems with those times when a long day is part of the job .
there were mixed reactions to a dedicated weekend team as opposed to some
type of rotating group . mixed feelings about whether the group would be open
to a mandatory rotating weekend schedule .
feel free to get back to me if you have any comments or clarification . i ' m
looking forward to our next meeting - bob",ham

daren you are correct in that this was only in mops for the 26 th . it was
edi ' d over to pops from the 25 th through the 31 st populating all days with
the 16 , 700 nom . the nom was never - 0 - out in pops therefore the change
notification process in pops did not pick up a change at this meter . this
meter is pathed by kim and confirmed by me - it is extremely odd that this
was missed in mops . the record would have been out of balance and someone ,
if not several people , normally would make a comment on this . also - all
of my records indicate that the 16 , 700 was good through the 31 st except the
mops entry . my confirmations with koch didn ' t reflect the - 0 - ; the last
report i have from koch indicated the 16 , 700 stayed on , there was no record
of a phone call indicating anything other than 16 , 700 . it is very odd for
this many checks and balances to fail . also , the volumes were being sent
back to mops which no one caught .
i have spoken with koch today and they agree that the 16 , 700 should have gone
to - 0 - therefore i have removed the nom from pops confirmed volumes and
re - allocated the meter . the oba has taken the hit and i am working off the
imbalance now .
daren , i am sorry that you had to look into this when you feel this is my
responsibility . stella was trying to help me out in clearing up errors

stella and charlotte ,
i looked into this deal . we sold this gas for one day only . in mops , the
path was nominated for 1 / 26 only . however , in pops the path was nominated
and confirmed for 1 / 26 - 1 / 31 . this should have been showing up as a
bridgeback error during the month . also , someone should have identified that
the path / nom in mops wasn ' t the same as the nom in pops . this discrepancy
should have been found before we closed out january .
i researched this problem by reviewing both systems ( looking at the path id
in pops , finding it in mops , and checking the audit on the path in mops ) .
this type of issue should be researched and solved by the logistics group ,
who has all the necessary tools to find the problem . the resolution , not the
problem , should have been presented to myself or the marketer , with an
explanation of what happened . some one still needs to find out how the gas
was confirmed for the 27 th - 31 st .
since the gas apparently flowed , we will have to apply the overflow to the
oba . unless you can find a missing transport contract .

welcome to the expatriate zone
welcome to the "" first "" issue of "" the expatriate zone , "" the official
newsletter of the new "" expatriate zone "" web site . after publishing "" the
temperate zone "" for the past two years , i ' m taking the opportunity to join
forces with bob segel who has been publishing "" the coconut modem "" with karen
coyne since april of 1994 .
last year , after operating in aol exclusively , bob created "" parrotkey . com ""
out on the "" internet "" where it would join it ' s sister site on aol and be
accessible to all parrot heads . at the time bob expanded "" pk , "" we had been
working on my little area of "" club st . somewhere , "" and the new
"" parrotkey . com "" seemed like the perfect place to open the doors of the club .
while we were talking about the direction we wanted to see "" club st .
somewhere "" and "" parrot key "" go , we could see that this was the perfect chance
to , as emeril says , "" kick it up a notch . ""
jimmy buffett ' s music was a big part of our lives , but even more so was the
"" expatriate lifestyle "" he sang about . a lifestyle that includes tropical
travel , sailing , boating , parasailing and surfing , and yes , the music and
lyrics of mr . james w . buffett .
so it is , that we created our new web site , "" the expatriate zone ""
, along with this newsletter of that same
name . in december , "" the expatriate zone "" opened its doors with its "" island
trading post "" with its holiday shopping service at the "" island trading post . ""
over 3 , 600 people visited the site the first day , and daily prizes were
awarded for the first two weeks . the "" island trading post "" will open again
soon , offering a complete line of tropical items , not just to those of us
that live a few blocks from wal - mart , but also for those of us lucky enough
to be on a sailboat or living on an island . for not , we ' ll start with the
"" t - shirt of the month . ""
we want "" the expatriate zone "" to not only keep you entertained and informed
while you toil away at your everyday "" corporate gig , "" but it will also get
you ready for that day you finally shuck it all and disappear down into "" the
expatriate zone . ""
we hope you all enjoy our new effort , and also continue to visit "" parrot key ""

"" expatriate of the month ""
james "" sunny jim "" white
when i first ventured on the internet in 1995 , i ran in to a guy named "" sunny
jim "" who was living down in the cayman islands . we never really got a chance
to connect , for which i am truly sorry . but , when something is supposed to
happen , it usually does .
on the first leg of my "" road dawg "" tour
( click on "" road dawg "" ) i stayed with my good friend alex & janet leist and
their wonderful children . over the five days i stayed at their house , alex
and i listened to a lot of music , and one of the guys we both liked was
"" sunny jim . "" i bought one of james ' cds from alex , and fell in love with it
immediately . the cd was his second , called "" life in the laid back lane . ""
little did i know that i would meet up with james and his roady "" shady floyd ""
several times over the next six months . james was embarking on his first real
tour of the us since he moved "" down island "" almost twelve years ago . we got
several chances to talk over the summer , and we will have an in depth article
about this "" expatriate "" soon on "" the expatriate zone "" web site . be sure to
watch for it .
in the meantime , here are a couple of quick things i learned about this great
musician . when i asked him about his "" expatriate "" status , his reply was ,
"" technically , an expatriate is someone who lives outside their own country ,
for whatever reason . for some it ' s legal reasons , others just because they
want to , or that ' s where the work is . i have been an expatriate for nearly
twelve years now . i have pretty fully lived the whole caribbean experience ,
from climbing the coconut trees and spear fishing , to sailing , scuba diving ,
hot afternoons on the beach and romantic moonlit nights under the swaying
palms . ""
even as james is about to repatriate himself and his family , i ask if there
were any other places he would consider living as an expatriate ? "" maybe
somewhere on the coast of mexico or in a group of islands that are all within
sailing distance of one another , "" was the advice he gave .
until we can learn more of "" sunny jim ' s "" world , stop by his web site at
and if you don ' t have one of his cds , including his
latest release "" sandbar serenade , "" for goodness sake , pick one up . you can
also read a great interview alex conducted with james at

travel into "" the zone ""
"" some are running from the irs ""
we strongly believe that we all have to get away from our computer screens
and out into the real world as often as we can . does this mean we give up one
our most useful tools of communication , computers ? heck no ! with laptops ,
cell phones and gps systems , we can go anywhere , and still stay in touch if
we feel the need . but get real and throw that "" pager "" away as soon as you can .
we hope to keep this section current and informative , hopefully hearing from
those of you already living your lives in "" the zone , "" helping the rest of us
prepare for our getaway from the cities . i ' m sure there are some of us that
are preparing to "" disappear "" to places like costa rica , where the "" the
expatriate zone "" will become an important tool .
how would you like to check out a place to "" disappear "" to and write it off
your taxes at the same time ? want to go down into "" the zone "" to places like
the bahamas , belize , st . croix , puerto rico , bonaire , the dominica republic
or saba ? want to do something for the planet , work with dolphins , save a
coral reef , or study monkeys and the rain forest at the same time ?
well we have the answer . check out these organization ' s web sites , and then
get some advice from your financial advisor on 501 c non - profit organizations .
depending on the tax bracket you ' re in , uncle sam could end up paying for up
to half the trip .

"" jimmydotcom ""
after many delays , "" jimmydotcom "" has finally gone to the printer with a due
date of the middle of april . i hit some "" bumps in the road "" on my way to
publishing the first ever book about the parrot head phenomena , but it was
all worth it .
this book isn ' t about jimmy buffett , it ' s about the effect of the internet on
parrot heads . for more information , visit . we
have a complete outline of the book , reviews from other parrot heads , and
samples of the pages on the site .
financial considerations have limited the first printing to 1 , 000 copies at
the present time , so if your even thinking of buying a book , i suggest you
reserve your copy by putting your name on the "" reservation list . "" you will be
under no financial obligation . it will simply indicate to my financial
partners ( who aren ' t parrot heads ) , just how many books we need to print . do
it right away , because pre - sales were brisk , and if enough of you reserve a
copy , i can get the financing to expand the first printing .
let ' s show the world what parrot heads stand for by making this book a big
success . when i was on the bhotm tour this summer , i had many people tell me
they wanted to buy an extra book to give to their boss . they wanted the boss
to understand why getting the day off for a buffett concert is so important .
maybe it will help the rest of us to explain ourselves to our friends "" that
just don ' t get it . ""
here ' s one of the latest reviews of the book from bob robinson , founder &
president of the sandlapper phc in south carolina . i had a great time with
this club on the "" road dawg "" tour , and shared an advance copy with his club :
"" when we received jackson ' s plea for pictures , our members were blown away .
we hustled up a package of pix , as did a majority of the parrot head clubs
from around the globe , and the result is pure parrothedonistic pleasure . this
collection is bound for glory in the annals of island time . if moderation is
your key to life then stay away from jimmydotcom , ' cause this book is packed
with those stories only we can tell . congratulations bubbafreak ! ""

club trini update
speaking of expatriates , how about the guys who play the true music of "" the
zone ? "" club trini ' s long awaited live cd will finally be coming out this
april , one year after it ' s recording . jimmy has been keeping mike and robert
pretty busy , so it ' s understandable that it took awhile . it will be the third
in the "" margaritaville cafe - late nite "" series . i can ' t wait to hear it , as
my wife and i were some of the lucky ones who were in new orleans when it was
recorded .
you can get a look at all the songs included on the new cd at club trini ' s
revamped web site at . along with the great songs we ' ve
become accustomed to , are a few i ' m pretty excited about . if you haven ' t
heard ct ' s version of "" african friend "" you ' re in for a real treat . along with
that , is a song that tina and nadirah have been treating audiences to this
past summer , "" cario "" and bob marley ' s "" no woman , no cry . ""
at the new web site , fans can "" now "" order their favorite club trini cds using
their credit cards . so there ' s no excuse to not owning everything available .
i think a true "" expatriate musical library "" is incomplete without club trini .
this summer , helen hiatt , jimmy and the coral reefer ' s wardrobe designer ,
came up with a shirt that club trini members lovingly call the "" ice cream
vendor "" shirt , which they wear out front at the start of the concert . ok ,
pete sometimes forgets his , and when he does have it on , it lost it ' s sleeves
somewhere along the way . there ' s a great design that has been applied to a
t - shirt that we all can own . check it out at their site .

jesters and friends
note card series
tro - pics has just released their first note cards
series from their "" jesters and friends "" original oils . friends , places and
musicians from past years have inspired these cards and parrot heads and
expatriates alike will want to have these great looking cards for those times
when an email just isn ' t personal enough .
the original artwork is also on sale at this site , so be sure to stop by and
visit them . included in the "" jesters "" series are our good friends tim glancey
and wally nickel .

millennium change bubba style
i ' ve got to tell you , i wasn ' t buying into this "" new millennium "" thing , one
bit . in fact , i had almost decided not to go to the buffett new year ' s eve
show . nothing to do with jimmy , but i just didn ' t get the whole hype . but at
the last minute , i had a change of heart .
and now after being a special guest at seagram ' s party honoring the new
margaritaville tequila , i ' m sure glad i went . the shows kind of melded
together for me , making the millennium change over very special .
if you want to hear more about this or see some pictures of both , visit our
new "" the expatriate zone "" web site at and go to

flash ! ! ! "" expatriated phans "" spotted south of the border
after making both of "" tropo travel ' s "" previous trips down to cobo san lucas ,
mexico , i had to miss this year ' s trek due to my being with the "" beach house
on the moon "" tour on it ' s florida , new orleans and houston swing .
as the story goes , those bad boys and girls from "" the expatriated phan club ""
showed up again , mainly for the t - shirts that
said , "" too much tequila . . . or not quite enough "" on the back . who are those
people anyway ? whenever i go to their web site , all of them have black bars
covering their eyes . if you want to see pictures of the trip or need info for
"" down to the banana republics - 2000 "" visit mike
mclain also has some other great trips planned this year , check them out .
speaking of "" tropo travel , "" if you need a hotel room for the vegas or irvine
shows and want a great deal , visit there site for some great rates . i ' m
joining some of my parrot head friends at the "" key largo , "" though i ' m kind of
afraid to be in a town like vegas with sue and ponch aprea from the detroit
phc . i ' m joining a lot of my other friends i met on the road there too . i
hate seeing jimmy in vegas , but i ' ve got to keep the streak alive , and seeing
all my parrot head friends will make it all worthwhile . i hope peter mayer
ends up playing there again this year .
and speaking of those great t - shirts , we have some neat shirts available at
the "" island store . "" they ' re similar to the shirt you got if you went on this
year ' s trip , except they have "" tropo travel ' s "" seaplane on the back and the
"" no bad days "" logo on the front breast . you can see a picture at

here are a couple of tidbits for your "" airplane nuts "" and pilots out there .
a new online friend who ' s a medivac chopper pilot is trying to start a parrot
head ' s pilot ' s association . if you ' re interested , contact dan at

i also ran across a really cool page that features jimmy ' s "" hemisphere
dancer "" including it ' s "" jamaican bullet hole . "" ed booth , jr . an attorney from
jacksonville , florida , who belongs to "" lawyer - pilots bar association "" is the
webmaster and creator .
the web site is "" grumman n 928 j "" ( flashback - how many of you remember the tv
show ' whirly birds ' ? wasn ' t their number n 975 b ? ) and is at
it shows a lot of pictures of jimmy ' s 1954
grumman i think you ' ll enjoy .
now all we need is for these guys to team up with the parrot heads pilot ' s
association .

i looked in path manager and i see two deals - 93480 and 93481 , but i don ' t
see deal 69176 for july forward that you mentioned below . also , please
verify that the deal for january through june is 93481 and if the 69176 deal
is correct for july forward .
stella :
i will need to set up accounting arrangements for these deals from january
forward . from daren ' s note below it appears that for january through june i
will need an hplr transportation contract put in pops . when daren and i get
the deal number issue resolved for july forward i will need an hplc contract
put into pops . also for july forward , i will need the hplc contract in pops
every month through december to allocate copano line gain to if it occurs .
thanks to both of you ,

fred ,
i have pathed the purchase from copano for 1999 in mops . jan - jun is under
hplr ( sitara 93481 ) . july forward is under hplc ( sitara 69176 ) . i
understand that i cannot renom this to the pipe for prior months , because the
callout allocations will be affected . so , you will need to set up accounting
arrangements to get the nom into pops .
let me know if you have any questions .

stella :
i need the above referenced contract put into pops for january , may , june ,
july , and august 1999 forward . i need the contract in pops for august
forward because i never know when copano will allocate line gain to itself .
in 1998 a spot contract was set up between hplr and copano pipeline / south
texas , l . p . with a synergi contract number 078 - 62210 - 101 and a global number
of 96016880 by karen lambert . per karen this old agreement was terminated by
dan hyvl due to hplr business change to ect . in 1999 , when copano began
allocating line gain to themselves again i contacted lauri , karen , and
yourself to see if i could get the contract in pops . karen sent me an e - mail
indicating that she set - up a new contract for this hplc line gain purchase -
global # 96022367 ( i don ' t have a "" synergi "" contract number ) . i know that in
3 / 99 lauri contacted bernard widacki at copano to discuss this issue .
i need lauri to review this and then i need the contract to be put in pops so
that i can correctly allocate the gas at this meter . i have not allocated
any line gain in 1999 and the volumes are small . karen is the most
knowledgeable about this contract , so i suggest that any questions be
directed to her regarding contract issues . karen worked with bernard widacki
at copano to set up the contract originally .

in this afternoon ' s meeting with producer services , jill mentioned that the
referenced well had been reperfed ( meaning they shot more holes in the well
piping allowing more gas to flow out of the well ) and was now producing
approximately 800 / day . per jill , the mdq on this well is 3000 / day . you may
want to look at getting this nom revised for the rest of the month .

based on the conversation we had at the meeting last thursday , i am
implementing the following changes to humble gas pipeline and king ranch gas
plant . if you disagree or feel you had a different understanding than the
items below , please be sure to call me asap .
1 . input hplc purchase from hplr liquids at meter 8793 ( hpl / hgpl ) . remove
the 3 rivers gas from the interconnect ticket and input on
the purchase deal .
2 . input hplc sale to hplr liquids at meters 9643 ( kgpl / hpl ) and 12
( kgpl / hgpl ) . remove 3 rivers volumes from the interconnect tickets
at these meters and input on the sales deals appropriately .
3 . change swing parameters for the king ranch contracts to swing on cage
ranch before swinging on 3 rivers gas . this will hopefully allow
the sale for 3 rivers gas to remain at one meter as much as possible .
i will hopefully have all of these changes made by the end of the day , and
have all contracts repathed . it is my understanding that we are implementing

hey guys ,
just wanted to make known my concerns on this issue . while i agree that
howard , robert and george needed to work on this together , i do not think
that howard should have been the driving force behind this . once we left the
meeting , they all convened on the 37 th floor and worked from howard ' s desk -
with howard sitting down doing much of the work . i also think that the below
e - mail should not have come from howard , but should have originated out of
the logistics group . i understand that howard has prior scheduling
experience , but he is not functioning in a scheduling role now and bascially
took on that role in getting this set up correctly . he too had to sit down
and try to figure out what needed to be done and set everything up correctly
( ? ) . in my opinion this is a kudoo for howard for stepping up , but i am
concerned at the role that he played . team effort is important and it ' s what
we all want between our groups , but i want to ensure that everyone does their
fair share and expectations are appropriately placed . let me know what you
both think . thanks !

business ( not that we understand it in its entirety ) . the last week of this

rita and lisa ,
why don ' t ya ' ll get together and determine a range of days / times that would
work for your groups to have a training session . ( over lunch or early
afternoon ) if you are interested , i would like to discuss how we operate the
hpl system and the processes we go through during the trading day . to help
with the discussion , i have maps which highlight the main points and areas
where we transact . ( there will be a few for you to keep at the desks . )
i did this with the logistics group . i think it went pretty well . if you
want to do this , we need to allow 1 . 5 to 2 hours to talk about everything .

i wanted to let all of you know how you will be charged for analysts if you
currently have or will have one in your rc for the year 2000 . the analyst
program is being handled differently than it was in 1999 . in addition to the
normal salary , benefits and payroll taxes , you will also be charged an
overhead administration fee for the program . you will be charged the
following monthly amounts for each analyst in the detail class code that i
have indicated below :
detail class description amount
1 salaries and wages $ 4 , 000
552 benefits 774
557 payroll taxes 360
820 corporate services 1 , 266
total monthly cost $ 6 , 400
the $ 4000 amount represents an average of all analyst salaries and does not
indicate what the analyst in your rc is paid . this amount will not change in
february as the $ 4000 already includes merit raise information for 2000 .
the $ 1266 represents the overhead costs of administering the program ,
including campus recruiting and office visits .
when you look at your rc report , you will see a line item labeled "" a and a
reclass "" in each of the detail classes identified above . enron north america
is invoiced by corp . for the costs of all analysts . financial operations
makes a manual journal entry each month to charge the appropriate rc . please
check your january 2000 rc report and make sure you were properly charged for
the correct number of analysts you have currently . if there are any errors ,
please let me know as soon as possible so that i can work with brian heinrich
to have it corrected in february . please continue to check your rc report
each month going forward . thanks .

review
as a follow up to my message last week on charges for analysts , i am
attaching the file that financial operations used to charge your rc with the
$ 6 , 400 in monthly costs that i detailed below . i have received a few calls
and e - mails stating that some reclasses need to be made because you no longer
have an analyst in your group . the information used by financial operations
to charge your rc was obtained from the org database . please review the
attached files for january and february to ensure that the proper rc was and
is going to be charged . if you have any corrections , please contact brian
heinrich at ext . 5 - 7677 asap since journal entries will need to be processed
by this friday , march 3 rd .
if you have any questions , please call me . i just want to let everyone know

subject : monthly charges for analysts on your rc report
i wanted to let all of you know how you will be charged for analysts if you
currently have or will have one in your rc for the year 2000 . the analyst
program is being handled differently than it was in 1999 . in addition to the
normal salary , benefits and payroll taxes , you will also be charged an
overhead administration fee for the program . you will be charged the
following monthly amounts for each analyst in the detail class code that i
have indicated below :
detail class description amount
1 salaries and wages $ 4 , 000
552 benefits 774
557 payroll taxes 360
820 corporate services 1 , 266
total monthly cost $ 6 , 400
the $ 4000 amount represents an average of all analyst salaries and does not
indicate what the analyst in your rc is paid . this amount will not change in
february as the $ 4000 already includes merit raise information for 2000 .
the $ 1266 represents the overhead costs of administering the program ,
including campus recruiting and office visits .
when you look at your rc report , you will see a line item labeled "" a and a
reclass "" in each of the detail classes identified above . enron north america
is invoiced by corp . for the costs of all analysts . financial operations
makes a manual journal entry each month to charge the appropriate rc . please
check your january 2000 rc report and make sure you were properly charged for
the correct number of analysts you have currently . if there are any errors ,
please let me know as soon as possible so that i can work with brian heinrich
to have it corrected in february . please continue to check your rc report
each month going forward . thanks .
if you have any questions , please call me .

classes
as a follow - up to stephen schwarz ' s message below regarding training
resources , i wanted to let everyone know that there will not be a charge in
2000 for any energy operations employee to attend any training classes that
have been developed by energy operations ( i . e . , sitara , unify and
magellan / livelink ) . there will be a charge to your rc , however , if an energy
operations employee signs up for one of these classes and fails to cancel
within the established guidelines .
i know there was a lot of concern regarding your budget and costs for
training classes after the corporate training department announced that there
would be a change in policy this year . your rc will be charged a fee for any
course that your employee signs up and attends through ernie . i just wanted
to clarify the costs associated for any systems training detailed above will
not be charged to your rc even though you and your employees use ernie to
register for these classes . i have instructed the people in the training
department who are in charge of billing to follow this policy . if you
receive a charge in error on your rc report , please let me know immediately
so that i can make the necessary corrections .
if you have any further questions , please call me . thanks .

subject : re : transport flash for feb 00
the rates are in the system correctly in unify ( so that we can invoice
correctly ) , but daren ' s group uses a sitara deal ( the transport usage
tickets ) to estimate desk transport in the p & l during the month . right now
we have not entered in or corrected rates in their transport usage tickets .
our group has not taken that step , since we have been most concerned with
settling the g / l ( after the month is over ) . by not having the right rates on
the transport usage tickets , the risk is that the p & l will be off during the
month . would we change process and let daren set up the transport usage
ticket and then have us enter the rate ? if so , we would need to change the
process with his group to put us in the process so that we can enter the
correct rate . please let me know what you want to do .

fyi . . . the economics group publishes this report every month to show how much
the marketing desk spent in transport . they can get their expense numbers
either from their estimate ( from cpr ) or from unify , where we put the rates
in .
one potential enhancement would be that in addition to managing rates for the
transport capacity tickets , we set up the rates for the transport usage
tickets . i am going through the transport usage tickets for february right
now ( as part of the market meter study ) and i see some rates i don ' t tie back
to lauri ' s matrix . for example , lauri ' s matrix shows 0 . 05 from thompsonville
to hsc , but the transport usage ticket ( updated by daren ' s group ) has 0 . 055 .
this means the economic estimate can be off . let me know what you want to do
with this .

tom , we attached both a consolidated p & l and an updated prudency schedule .
the weater hedge made $ 165 , 000 today . the only odd thing that we saw was the
physical change due to deal changes with the hplc operational desk . this desk
is a desk that is set up to account for fuel , gas loss , and physical ua 4 , we
have tickets out there with zero volumes on them that get updated after the
month is over once volume management knows where the gas needs to be
allocated . what we found out that happened was that in the last week of
february and in the first week of march sitara added volumes to these tickets
before were were running comparison reports to see the changes . darren
noticed the incorrect volumes on these tickets and had logistics zero them
out . darren thought that the changes would have no position effect as if it
were a deal between hplc and texas , but it is actuall as if we changed a deal
that we did with another region . the value was offset by changes in tufco
and storage . we released $ 270 , 000 out of march prudency to keep you flat for

i can then dump my other phone line . actually will end up spending less for

thanks for the info on the stock option . that is the closing price as of

1066,"Subject: sitara position
please use the position manager home button .
when using the sitara position manager , and you drill down to view details
or change the dates , the position manager keeps
all your views running in the background . this feature allows you to use the
back and forward buttons to keep your views running .
on the downside , if you keep these views running but do not really intend to
go back to look at them , the system and your pc are working harder
to keep all the old views active and updated .
the home button sends you back to your default view - the first view you had
up when you hit apply . by clicking this button , your
position manager will clear out the old views the next time you drill in .
this is the only way to clear out the old views that you no longer need .
if you do not use the home key , and keep drilling in and changing the dates ,
the position manager is still keeping all the your views for
the day running in the backgound .
what we have found is by the end of the day , a user that does not clear out
the old views can have well over 30 views open , which is like having
30 position managers up on your pc . when that user closes down , the position
gets locked up for a while as it tries to clear out all the old views .
we will be making some changes soon to that should resolve this issue as far
as the sitara machine is concerned ; however , your pc may still be
slow with excessive unneccessary views open . we could make a change to
limit the number of active views you can have open , but at this time
i am not sure that is necessary ; regardless , in the mean time , please
remember to use your home button .
other helpful hints -
did you know you can shrink you tool bar ? tools options - uncheck show tool
bar text labels -
did you know you can split your position screen to have pipes on top and
zones and meters below ? tools options - show drill down second panel -

enron capital minnesota power
and light co . , opinion no . 12 , issued april 14 , 1978 , mimeo at 24 - 5 .
[ 65 , 229 ]
in both cases , the commission rejected rate design features where there was
no evidence in the record showing that the rate design features reflected
cost incurrence , id . in its order setting this proceeding for hearing , the
commission took note of edison ' s proposed seasonal differential and
specifically directed that the parties fully address the issues related to
the cost support for the seasonal rate design , commission order issued march
30 , 1979 , mimeo at 4 - 5 . on october 9 , 1980 , the parties were directed by the
presiding judge to identify in their initial briefs the portions of the
record that relate to cost support for the seasonal differential .
the requirement that edison provide cost support for its seasonal
differential , as discussed supra , is also set forth in the commission ' s
filing requirements for rate schedules : if the rate design is intended to
reflect costs , the applicant must show how it reflects costs ; if the rate
design is not intended to reflect costs , the applicant must justify the
departure from costbased rates , 18 cfr o 35 . 13 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( iii ) statement p .
edison ' s seasonal differential is intended to lessen the costs imposed upon
it by its prominent summer peak . edison reasons that , since it must build
capacity to meet its prominent summer peak , charging more in the summer would
give customers an incentive to control their summer demands and , therefore ,
edison ' s cost of adding capacity would be reduced ( tr . 169 ) . accordingly ,
edison must show how its seasonal differential reflects the costs imposed on
it by summer demand , under the commission ' s filing requirements in 18 cfr o 35 .
13 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( iii ) statement p . further , even purpa section 111 ( d ) ( 4 ) relied upon
by edison states that rates "" shall be on a seasonal basis which reflects the
costs of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of
the year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for such utility . ""
( emphasis added . )
further , support for relying on marginal rather than average costs comes from
the commission itself . in its order of march 30 , 1979 setting this cause for
hearing , mimeo at 4 , 5 , the commission , in commenting on time of day and
seasonal rates , mentioned that it encourage innovative rate design to match
more closely rates to costs . in this regard , the commission cited its order
no . 537 , supra at 4 , which specifically suggests use of pricing mechanisms
based on marginal cost principles
[ 65 , 236 ]
for jurisdictional wholesale sales . under the circumstances in this case ,
where the sale of economy energy is related to edison ' s costs in adding or
eliminating additional excess capacity , it is appropriate to establish the
price for economy transactions on marginal costs . this provides a more close
matching of the rate to the cost than would a rate design based on average
costs . accordingly , winnetka ' s position on pricing of economy energy will not
be adopted .
affirmed and reversed - see next paragraph
comm - opinion - order , 23 ferc ? 61 , 219 , commonwealth edison company , docket nos .
er 79 - 182 - 000 and er 80 - 106 - 000 , ( may 12 , 1983 )
turning to commonwealth ' s exceptions , we find that the judge correctly
rejected the seasonal differential . even if we accept the company ' s
interpretation of purpa , it still has not cited any record evidence
whatsoever of a difference in costs between summer and nonsummer months .
without at least some showing of a cost difference , it is impossible to make
a judgment on the reasonableness of the company ' s 15 . 25 % proposal . we
therefore uphold the judge on this point .
we reverse the judge ' s adoption of a price set at 110 % of the utility ' s
incremental costs , however , and approve the type - b split - savings method
proposed by commonwealth . under this method , economy transactions are
arranged for a 12 - hour or similar period at a fixed price based on cost
estimates at the time of the agreement . if the utility ' s incremental costs
rise to the point that continued supply would become burdensome , the utility
may terminate supply . we find this method superior to that proposed by staff
in that implementation is greatly simplified . cost determinations need not be
made as frequently .
related to pmas

and transmission rate adjustments and extensions , december 31 , 1980 , 10 cfr
903 , 45 fr 86976
[ 36 , 741 ]
historically , many purpa - type standards have been used in designing wholesale
rates for the sale of federal hydroelectric power . pmas analyze costs to
establish revenue requirements and consider this information in designing
rates . declining block rates for energy were once used by the pmas but
subsequently were found inappropriate and eliminated from rate schedules .
many of the pmas for years have been effectively using various forms of load
management measures in their rate schedules , such as scheduling limitations ,
loadshaping , capacity and energy overrun charges , etc . bpa has had a history
of using seasonal rates for wholesale firm capacity and energy and also
offered its direct service industrial customers interruptible rates some time
ago . southwestern has had interruptible capacity rates in effect since 1957 .
these examples demonstrate the willingness of the pmas to implement
purpa - type standards where applicable .
many of these purpa - type standards , when applied appropriately in the design
of pma rates , can serve to implement the purposes of purpa by encouraging
conservation of energy , efficient use of resources and facilities , and
equitable rates . the public participation process will provide an opportunity
to examine these and other appropriate concepts .
the pmas will continue to review and revise their power marketing practices
on a system - by - system basis to serve the purpa objectives . the assistant
secretary for resource applications , working with the administrators of the
power administrations , and after receiving public comment , will consider the
adoption of rate design guidelines , similar in form to the guidelines in ra
6120 . 2 on financial accounting and ratemaking , which will reflect the
experience gained by the pmas in their system - by - system approach to rate
design .

( 4 ) seasonal rates . - - the rates charged by an electric utility for providing
electric service to each class of electric consumers shall be on a seasonal
basis which reflects the costs of providing service to such class of
consumers at different seasons of the year to the extent that such costs vary
seasonally for such utility .

pricing flexibility may take several different forms . for instance , a
contract could provide qfs with a price floor applicable to all the power
supplied to the utility , but still provide for higher variable unit prices
reflecting daily or seasonal periods . the price floor would provide the
revenue stream necessary for the qf to secure financial support while
[ 32 , 174 ]
the price variability would induce the qf to maximize deliveries in peak - load
periods when the utility values additional supplies most . of course , the
price floor should not exceed the minimum value of the utility ' s avoided
cost . similarly , a contract could provide for a two part price - - a fixed
payment for capacity and an energy price for power delivered . the qf would be
assured a minimum revenue stream based on the value of its capacity . the
variable energy component would allow the utility to dispatch the qf capacity
only when it was economic . whatever the pattern of contract payments , rates
for purchases from qfs should always reflect how well the characteristics of
the suppliers ' power match the purchasing utility ' s need . this will ensure
that the qf will make most production decisions on the basis of rates
reflecting avoided costs ( rather than the guaranteed average rate ) and , at
the same time , will receive revenues sufficient to attract investors .
to avoid problems such as those associated with take - or - pay contracts in the
natural gas industry , the commission wishes to stress the danger of including
forecasted fuel costs in the fixed rate structure of long - term contracts ,
especially in combination with the specification of minimum purchase
quantities . the commission also encourages the use of time - of - day and
seasonal rates in flexible pricing structures for long - term contracts .

rather than specifying that exact time - of - day or seasonal rates for purchases
are required , however , the commission believes that the selection of a
methodology is best left to the state regulatory authorities and nonregulated
electric utilities charged with the implementation of these provisions .",ham

subject : mobil discrepancies
lee ,
here are some specific situations i am trying to resolve regarding volume on
centana :
purchase from mobil :
2 / 99 - the purchase by hplr for 155 , 000 mms in deal 60978 was never billed by
mobil .
( a purchase of gas in storage with no physical movement per comments in
sitara ) .
per our conversation friday , it sounds like hplc does owe mobil for his
gas , right ?
sale to mobil :
1 / 2000 - per the pipe statement provided by greg bonin for centana volumes ,
299 , 893
flowed in january . i billed 299 , 893 and mobil paid it .
logistics said 19 , 893 of the gas that flowed was not our sale to mobil
because
the gas wasn ' t scheduled . in addition , if the 19 , 893 were a sale to mobil ,
the
point would not be in balance in the system . the source of 280 , 000 of the
gas
says they only sold 280 , 000 mms and not any more . no other sources are in the
system .
i assume if the 19 , 893 wasn ' t consumed by mobil , they wouldn ' t have
paid for it . is there storage involved here ? if so , whose storage and how
did it work ?
there are sales in other months with discrepancies on centana with smaller
volumes
than in 1 / 2000 . once i understand what happened in january , maybe that will
help me
with the other months .
please let me know if there is any other information you need from me
relating to
the questions above and when would be a good time for you to discuss this . i
can bring
the pipe statements to you if that would help .
thanks ,

the cilco volumes are different than the confirmed volumes to cilco . please
review the attached the spreadsheets from lisa kinsey , the central desk

january 2000 . cilco withdrew 200 , 000 mmbtu ' s more than we booked @ bammel .
please let me know the best way to correct the problem . i suspect the
variance is showing up as a transport imbalance . also , the nomination for
the current month is 7 , 327 mmbtu instead of 7 , 000 mmbtu per day . 7 , 000 is

daren and lauri :
we do have a problem with some of our mirrored meters . when mips receives an
"" incomplete "" from the parent meter it sends a - 0 - to pops . yes , this is a
big problem . our pops team ( romeo d ' souza ) has identified this problem and
notified mips . however , he was told this was not a priority item . in the
mean time we are overriding the volumes in pops with the estimated volumes .
this particular meter was correct last night , the 14 th rolled last night from
mips and overrode the bav with a - 0 - from day 14 forward .
this was corrected this morning and the meter re - allocated .

this is an outside measured volume that we don ' t receive volumes on until
month ' s end so systematically , no information equals zero . spi , the software
vendor for mips is investigating all of the rules currently in place for file
transfers , particularly 0 volumes . the only possible solution is to tag all
zero volumes sent in the nightly file process as ( i ) incomplete . i will let

stephanie ,
the problem with the january payment is that the deal is set up incorrectly
in sitara . for january production deal 153864 shows hplc purchasing gas
from gmt company inc , not gmt inc . someone needs to either correct the deal
for 1 / 00 or put in a new deal , then i can do an accounting arrangement to
make the necessary correction . it is correct for 2 / 00 on deal 156292 . i
emailed daren on this because i see his name in sitara as the contact , but i
am not sure who actually takes care of it .

instead of gmt , inc . ( ba 75046 ) of houston . these companies are not

although the gas is non - spec , the volumes and gas total inerts are low enough
that it can be blended okay before reaching beaumont . go for it .
as a precaution , we are starting a trend and i want to be very cautious .
once we connect a well , we can ' t go backwards . please be specific with gmt

we do not have deal to enter for this . you need to look at the entire midtex
line for each of the days that are out of balance . if we are short at katy ,
i would think that we would be long at dewville . ( many times , our receipts
from the midtex line at katy are offset by our deliveries to tufco at the
tap . ) this should help you fix the january problem . also , for december , you
may need to ask pg & e where they show the delivery for western . is it at hpl
katy , as our records show , or is it at pge ' s another point on the midtex
line ? in any case , we don ' t have deliveries to make . the only other remedy
is to book the variance on the partnership imbalance .

please be advised that contract no . teco 9121 shows in the global contract

pg & e gas transmission teco , inc . . apparently , the pipeline name was entered

transmission teco , inc . . the contract name should be pg & e gas transmission

i would like to change the pipeline to reflect the correct pipeline name
effective april 1 , 2000 . thus it will not affect the previous noms for this
contract .

replication or anything else with the system .

good afternoon !
no , this isn ' t a new tip - just a follow - up on the one i sent this
morning . i received some good responses and wanted to pass a couple of them
along .
kevin wrote to say that this tip works like a charm , except for one thing :
he ' s had trouble with the router bit not being perfectly centered on the
base , so his dadoes have ended up less than perfect . i referred to this
briefly at the end of the tip , but here ' s a quick solution for avoiding
the problem .
before routing the dado in the gauge , first mark a point on the base of
your router . ( i simply add a piece of masking tape since it ' s easy to
see . ) then when routing the gauge ( and later , the panel ) , always keep
this mark against the straightedge . your dadoes should be right on .
another email came in from mike , who suggested making two alignment
gauges . then you can clamp one at each end of the workpiece before you
clamp the straightedge fence down . this prevents the "" wiggling "" that
often occurs when one end is clamped before the other . great tip !
a big thanks to all who have been sending in suggestions . it ' s great to
hear that so many people are enjoying the tips .
talk to you again in a few weeks .

gas for the month of april . on a side note , we will bring down our gas
turbine
generator on sunday morning . this will bring our high pressure gas

the pipeline outage time mentioned in the memo below needs to be revised .
actual construction time should be 7 days and pipeline outage time should be
3 days max . this outage time , which is longer than the norm , is due to the
fact that we will have to remove the existing line and replace it in the same
ditch before tie ins take place .
as an update , the first train is now scheduled to cross late today . they now
say that it may take 4 weeks to get all the trains in and out before we are
able to begin replacing our line .
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
i have been advised by the deer park rr representative , dean truitt , that
the rail cars will begin arriving on 3 / 15 / 00 .
per our conversations today , please have someone on tuesday 3 / 13 adjust the
regulators at simpson and at shell deer park so that 280 psig is the maximum
pressure in that pipeline section .
i will maintain contact with deer park on the duration of this project and
keep you informed . it is likely that the duration of the pressure reduction
will be on the order of 2 weeks .
after the initial 700 rail cars have entered and exited their facility , deer
park will remove their railroad bed and allow us to perform a pipeline
replacement at that location . this replacement would involve an outage on
this segment of pipeline for approximately 7 days . i would anticipate that
this outage would occur in early april .
thanks for your cooperation in this matter .

1187,"Subject: fyi - new product on eol
just so everyone is on the same page :
based on jennifer and dale ' s discussions with eric bass , a new "" tokenized
period "" will be set up in eol . the intent of this period ( quick overview ) is
to allow for gas flow monday through friday and no flow on the weekends .
this will generally be traded for in full month or rest of the month
increments .
it is my understanding the although the trade can be conveyed correctly to
the customer and priced accordingly using eol , the trade itself ( with
multiple monday - friday , no flow during weekend periods ) cannot be handled
internally by eol . just as eol is not able to handle this trade , the sitara
bridge from eol cannot handle this trade . because of this , there should be
heighten attention by trade capture given to the eol bridge monitor . these
trades will error out and will have to be entered manually .
an effort needs to be evaluated and prioritized by both applications ( eol and
sitara ) on how a deal with multi - periods can flow without human
intervention . this has not been started . in the meantime , a deal of this
nature will have to be entered manually .
how do i know that a particular deal has multi - period flow ? once the eol
product has been set up , jennifer and / or dale will let all involved know .
the person ( s ) responsible for entering the deal will have to understand what
is meant by the eol product ' s delivery period and enter the deal
accordingly .
for example , assume that a deal has been traded for april :
four delivery periods ( separate lines ) should be included in the sitara
ticket
start : 04 / 03 stop : 04 / 07
04 / 10 04 / 14
04 / 17 04 / 21
04 / 24 04 / 28
each delivery period ( line ) should have the same pricing
remember to enter the eol deal number when creating the sitara trade .
also remember that paths created in unify assume the stop date is open
ended . every effort needs to be made to make sure the appropriate end date
is on the path ; otherwise
the number of reconciling items will increase .
please forward this information to anyone else you think might be impacted .
any concerns , please contact sheri thomas or myself .

1191,"Subject: procedure for adding new capacity tickets for multi - desk service
utilization
in order to provide the ability to track transport expense by desk , sitara
was modified to allow multiple transport capacity tickets for the same
service contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is
tagged as "" primary "" . here is the procedure for setting up new capacity
tickets to reflect the "" other "" desks :
a . you will probably first notice this via a warning / error message in path
manager when building a new path . the message will read something like
"" source / destination 123456 for desk imct does not match service contract 3434
and will be removed . ""
b . make note of the deal number in the service list of the service contract
that you were using in the new path .
c . open that transport capacity deal in sitara . then hit copy .
d . on the new deal :
change the buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the supply
or market deal that you are pathing with . if it a contract for which we are
agent , then don ' t change the buyer but instead change the agent to the new
desk . the "" primary "" deal will carry the actual agent .
changing the buyer causes the contract field to get blanked out . re - select
the contract .
just above the various exchange line items is a primary deal check box .
un - check it .
on each exchange line item , change the mdq to zero and for any negotiated
rates , uncheck them as well . the "" primary "" deal will carry the mdq and
any negotiated demand , commodity or fuel .
hit release .
e . you may need to re - retrieve path manager . you should see the deal number
in the service list now read "" multiple "" . right - click / service deals will list
the specific deals .
f . re - build the path as you originally desired . the warning / error message
should not appear again .
this could occur for any combination of desk and service contract .
please file this in your "" call dave if i can ' t find this "" folder .

hello ,
we have prepared january and february data and will be scheduling meetings
with you in the next few weeks . for the month of march , please provide a
completed "" hours "" survey for each position within your group . this survey
will collect the time your team spent on performing their activities in the
month of march .
note : we are now collecting eol related activities . if you spend time
directly supporting eol , and your survey does not have an activity that you
can assign these times to , please contact me as soon as possible so we can
add the appropriate activities to your survey .
to fill out the survey :
at the top of the spreadsheet , you will see a box labelled "" select your rc "" .
click on the box and input your rc number , which will need to be 4 digits .
once you have done this , another box will appear with the message "" select
position from drop box ! "" you can then select the position ( i . e . , staff ,
specialist , etc . ) and "" ok "" . the choices for positions are based on
information contained in the org database ( i . e . , if a position is not listed
that should be , please call me to discuss as it would indicate that
corrections need to be made to the database ) . once you have the list of
activities , please input hours ( for the entire month ) for each activity
listed in the column labelled "" hours "" .
if you ' re filling out the survey for your team , save a file for each of the
positions you fill out for your team prior to filling out the next position .
if you do not , the information will be lost .
we have included february compiled hours per position ( if you had two
specialists performing the same activity - 20 hours each , the "" last month ""
column would show a total of 40 hrs for that month ) . as with last month , you
have the option to complete the survey on behalf of your entire group or send
this survey to each of your team members , allowing each individual to fill
out the time they spent on each activity . if there are any activities you
perform not included in your survey , please contact me as soon as possible
for a copy of the activity dictionary .
please return these surveys by end of day wednesday , april 5 th . if this is a
problem , please notify me or lisa cousino immediately .
thanks ,
shari

1208,"Subject: march activity survey
as you are aware , we are starting to collect data for our march price model .
i ' ve attached a survey to help us collect the data that will be driving your
costs from the activities to the commercial teams . in the ' data ' tab , please
select the your rcs , and fill in the driver quantity for the requested driver
for the month of february . please fill out the attached activity driver
survey with march numbers for your rc by end of day wednesday , april 5 th . if
your group currently generates a standard report that captures the surveyed
data , please send the report to me , and put me on your recipient list
beginning next month . this will eliminate your need to fill out this survey
every month . if you would like us to collect this information from someone
within your team beginning next month , please let me know .
please take this opportunity to verify the following :
1 . the driver indicates a measure for the time and effort your team spent to
perform these activities for each commercial team .
2 . the activity is spent in support of the commercial teams identified
( please let us know otherwise )
3 . if the activity is using an allocation ( for example "" allocate 0469 "" or
"" 80 - 20 split "" ) , that the percentage allocated to each commercial team has not
changed from last month . ( please let us know if it has changed what the new
allocation is ) .
in reference to these surveys , please note :
if you are allocating only infrastructure costs to some commercial teams
listed in the survey , please identify them . we will take your business
support costs ( such as feedback , training , etc . ) and allocate them evenly
among these teams .
the costs for "" commercial team specific "" activities that you filled time out
for in the january time survey will be directly allocated to that commercial
team ( e . g . genco support will trace 100 % of its costs to genco ) .
please let us know if you have any questions on this survey .

hey guys , i finally found one that is true ! i went down to the
gap myself and redeemed my gift certificates already ! ! ! i sent
enough e - mails to get over two hundred dollars worth of clothes from
the gap ! you know , with all the crap sent over the mail , it is good to
know that something finally rings true in this environment of virtual
deception . send it to everyone you know , and you too can have a whole new
wardrobe , courtesy of the gap ! isn ' t it grand ?
hi ! my name is janelle mccan , founder of the gap .
you have probably heard about the e - mail from abercrombie and fitch offering
twenty five dollar gift certificates to every five people you sent that
letter to . my question is : did it work ? most of you who tried it will
probably say no .
but this letter is not prank like others you have experienced . i am offering
thirty five dollar gift certificates to every seven people you send this to .
when you have finished sending this letter to as many people as you wish , a
screen will come up . it will tell you how much you have earned in gap gift
certificates . print that screen out and bring it to your local gap store .
the sales clerk will give you your certificates and you can shop baby ! this
is a sales promotion to get our name out to young people around the world .
we
believe this project can be a success , but only with your help .
thank you for your support !
sincerely ,
janelle mccan

1216,"Subject: procedure for adding new capacity tickets for multi - desk service
utilization - revised
revision in bold . pass on to any who may need this .
in order to provide the ability to track transport expense by desk , sitara
was modified to allow multiple transport capacity tickets for the same
service contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is
tagged as "" primary "" . here is the procedure for setting up new capacity
tickets to reflect the "" other "" desks :
a . you will probably first notice this via a warning / error message in path
manager when building a new path . the message will read something like
"" source / destination 123456 for desk imct does not match service contract 3434
and will be removed . ""
b . make note of the deal number in the service list of the service contract
that you were using in the new path .
c . open that transport capacity deal in sitara . then hit copy .
d . on the new deal :
change the buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the supply
or market deal that you are pathing with . if it a deal for which we are
agent , then don ' t change the buyer but instead change the agent to the new
desk . the "" primary "" deal will carry the actual agent . the agent
contract will get cleared . re - select the agent contract .
changing the buyer causes the contract field to get blanked out . re - select
the pipeline contract .
just above the various exchange line items is a primary deal check box .
un - check it .
on each exchange line item , change the mdq to zero and for any negotiated
rates , uncheck them as well . the "" primary "" deal will carry the mdq and
any negotiated demand , commodity or fuel .
hit release .
e . you may need to re - retrieve path manager . you should see the deal number
in the service list now read "" multiple "" . right - click / service deals will list
the specific deals .
f . re - build the path as you originally desired . the warning / error message
should not appear again .
this could occur for any combination of desk and service contract .

fyi . . . .
this change went in for the deal validation group . it gives them the
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back .
impact to logistics - unify
if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge
backed , it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name
will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place .
one problem may be with the imbalance data sets , which are not in production
yet . . . . . . ( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths )
this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where
nominations were sent for entire month )
can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe
guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing .
unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause
an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order
to get a clean quick response .
what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take
place ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? )
i have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i
can get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to
put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when
these type of changes are needed .
will keep you posted .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with
confirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution :
if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and
then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message :
"" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure
pipeline allows this change . ""
some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is
feedback - i assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems
( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal .
before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just

fyi . . . .
this change went in for the deal validation group . it gives them the
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back .
impact to logistics - unify
if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge
backed , it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name
will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place .
one problem may be with the imbalance data sets , which are not in production
yet . . . . . . ( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths )
this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where
nominations were sent for entire month )
can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe
guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing .
unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause
an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order
to get a clean quick response .
what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take
place ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? )
i have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i
can get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to
put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when
these type of changes are needed .
will keep you posted .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with
confirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution :
if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and
then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message :
"" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure
pipeline allows this change . ""
some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is
feedback - i assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems
( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal .
before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask
the unify team .
there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im
market east - but not from
ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be
the same legal entity .
"" warning - not the same legal entity ""
also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals
( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) .
once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items
were locked down for a reason .

changing counterparty names on sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact
to any downstream processes .
i hope the following will give more clarification .
let me know if you have any questions or need more detail !
thanks ,
dg 3 - 9517
sitara / unify - process
* scenario - counterparty name changes on sitara deal ticket after deal had
been pathed , scheduled & bridged back from unify .
* impact - zero impact to logistics & volume management , absolutely
harmless . settlements has process in place to eliminate issues .
* process -
counterparty a in sitara changes to counterparty b .
ctprty a was on original path sent to pipeline .
the new name ( ctprty b ) does bridge over to unify .
ctprty a remains at the path level in unify ( gui display does not change )
ctprty b is now displayed at the deal level in unify . the field is now
highlighted to indicate a change occurred . ( gui display changes only at high
level , not on path )
the scheduler has choice to repath ( if necessary ) , or not re - path
if re - pathing occurs , the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path
unify pushes back the deal number & meter to sitara ( not ctprty info )
balancing works on deal number & meter only ( not ctprty info )
the confirmation desk utilizes the information in sitara ( where all
information is correct )
volume management utilizes the information in unify for pipeline tie - out .
( all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match
up perfectly )
settlements utilizes information in unify .
settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts , which
would create two notification entries
if invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty , re - draft would occur .
( note : there was an issues discovered on reports which it is correcting now )
autonoms "" tom ' s words of warning "" -
previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after
deals were pathed and nominated . basically it would change a key on an edi
path ( duns number ) not affecting any other of the information already
nominated to the pipeline . if the scheduler re - nominated , data at the
pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have no way to correct
the problem . in most cases , the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to
manually cut the original nominated volume . this is not an issue with unify
( as explained above ) .

this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where
nominations were sent for entire month )
can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe
guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing .
unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause
an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order
to get a clean quick response .
what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take
place ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? )
i have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i
can get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to
put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when
these type of changes are needed .
will keep you posted .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with
confirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution :
if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and
then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message :
"" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure
pipeline allows this change . ""
some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is
feedback - i assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems
( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal .
before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask
the unify team .
there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im
market east - but not from
ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be
the same legal entity .
"" warning - not the same legal entity ""
also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals
( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) .
once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items
were locked down for a reason .
if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created
using these deals will get corrupted . always check
with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in
unify .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other
than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) .
in addition , this release will also capture "" near - time "" the contract changes
that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be
necessary .
new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal
manager .
new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out
of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) .
once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you
are looking for will appear .
i mention "" near - time "" because we are constrained by the amount of time it
takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then
updates its information

it is becoming increasingly clear that the development of ecommerce will have
a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad
array of industries . through enrononline , enron has quickly become a major
catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries .
enrononline has been an enormous success since its launch . since launch , we
have completed 67 , 043 transactions on line , with a total dollar value of over
$ 25 billion . enrononline is now the largest ecommerce site in the world .
we believe that the competitive success of enrononline is due to one very
specific reason . in addition to providing a web - based platform for
transactions , enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the
site . we stand ready at all times , in any market conditions , to buy and sell
at the posted price . this converts a  & bulletin board  8 ( the more typical
ecommerce concept ) into a true market . there are very few , if any ,
competitors that can provide this capability .
we are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be
dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies . if we are
correct , this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for enron .
accordingly , we are initiating a major new effort to capture this
opportunity . effective today we are creating a new business , enron net
works , to pursue new market development opportunities in ecommerce across a
broad range of industries . it is likely that this business will ultimately
be our fifth business segment , joining transmission mike
mcconnell , chief operating officer ; and jeff mcmahon , chief commercial
officer . these individuals will comprise the office of the chairman for
enron net works and remain on the executive committee of enron corp .
replacing greg whalley as president and chief operating officer of enron
north america is dave delainey , who will also join enron  , s executive
committee .
global technology will remain intact but will now be a part of enron net
works . it will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did as
an enron global function . philippe bibi will remain the chief technology
officer for all of enron corp . and continues to be responsible for the
development of worldwide technology standards and platforms .
enrononline , headed by louise kitchen , will also remain intact and will now
be a part of enron net works . the success of enrononline enables us to
utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets . in addition , the
following individuals are included in enron net works along with their
current ecommerce initiatives : harry arora , public financial securities ; jay
fitzgerald , new markets identification ; bruce garner , metals ; and greg piper ,
pulp and paper .
over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational
design and will provide full details on this exciting new business

i need to have these tickets set up so the excess volumes will be priced
correctly in unify . currently unify is adding all excess volume for each day
and pricing the first 10 , 000 at a certain price and anything over 10 , 000 at a
different price . for example meter 1553 may have 5000 on the first , meter
1384 may have 5000 , and meter 1552 may have 5000 . unify currently prices the
first 10 , 000 at a certain price , and 5000 at a different price . this is
incorrect because none of the meters exceeded 10 , 000 , each meter should be
priced at the first tier level . robert needs to set up one additional sale
ticket and one additional buyback ticket , but he will not schedule gas to
these tickets . anita luong will move the volumes to the correct ticket when
she allocates the volumes each month . equistar receives manual invoices each
month because they need to see the sale and the buyback on the same invoice ,
and they also need to have each meter invoiced separately . i need to have
these tickets set up to clean up my unify draft invoices .

agreement
thanks for the info !
as greg mentioned in the staff meeting today , the intent is that this
restructured deal is papered effective 4 / 1 / 00 . the impact is potentially
that the gas is not pathed properly by counterparty or on the appropriate
transport / gathering agreements , etc . if any rates are changing , then those
need to be changed in our systems also . there may be other areas of changes
also - i ' m not attempting to list them all . rather i just want to make
people aware that retroactive deals can have impacts on the daily operations .
thanks for the information .

impact , if any ? thanks .

brenda ,
per your request , attached are the draft documents which will be used to
finalize the new gathering arrangment between hpl and coastal , the revenue
sharing arrangement between exxon and hpl ( transaction agreement ) and the
residue gas purchase agreement between coastal , as seller and hpl as buyer
( amendment to wellhead purchase agreeement ) .
i do not have a copy of the processing agreement between exxon and coastal ,
as such agreement does not involve us ( and i believe it is far from
finalized . the only other document that i plan to prepare is a termination
agreement relative to the current liquifiables purchase agreement between
exxon as purchaser and hpl as seller - - this termination will be affective as
of 4 / 1 / 2000 .

from : celestedeo @ aol . com
sent : tuesday , april 11 , 2000 1 : 21 pm
subject : special prayer request
hi ,
i am coming to you with a very special prayer request . we have some good
friends here in nashville , mark and melanie burress and their one year old
baby gracie , who have recently received some devastating news . mark was
diagnosed in december with leukemia . his is normally a very slow spreading
form of the disease but unfortunately his is spreading extremely fast . he
also has a rare dna type and only about 12 people on the bone marrow donor
list ( out of 4 . 5 million ) were possible matches and all have since been
elimnated . we held a bone marrow drive in his behalf at church this past
weekend and over 1200 people came to donate . this amazed the people running
the drive because they said they normally get a few hundred at the most .
if a donor is not found by june his chances are very , very slim to live to
july . he has chosen to have his bone marrow transplant in houston at the
anderson hospital so i am asking if there is anyone in houston who knows of
a
strong , supportive congregation near the hospital that they may attend ( when
possible ) while they are there , that would be greatly appreciated . if a
donor is located , they say the transplant procedure is very difficult and he
won ' t be able to have any contact with his baby for several months due to
his
immune system being weakened . as you can imagine , this would put his wife
in
a severe state of limbo , having to be primary caregiver to someone who is
incapacitated and a baby without the two being able to be together .
it is difficult to watch someone with so much to give and so much to live
for
to be facing such a hard fight . please keep his family in your prayers and
i
know if there is a miracle with marks ' name on it , god will provide it .
if you could please pass this on to the chi sigs / regina list , every little
prayer they get will be appreciated .
thank you !

i just spoke briefly with brian riley , who is working to restructure the knig

contracts attached . as i talked with brian , the king ranch set up as he is
negotiating will be simplified . the intent , as i understood it , is that we
will no longer buy at the wellhead . rather , coastal is entering into a a
gathering agreement with hpl to buy at the wellhead and ship to the plant .
hplc will buy at the tailgate of the plant , net of pvr . so there will not be
future settlements with exxon on liquids . the paper has not been returned
from coastal or exxon yet , but the deal is effective 4 / 1 / 00 . everything will
be under new agreements , with receipts and deliveries by different
counterparties . the gas flow continues the same , just under new contracts
and different counterparties .
daren , pat and stella : daren , brian said he would get with you to discuss
the deal in further detail . please include pat and stella in the discussion
also . the contracts should be reviewed and understood to ensure proper

there was no flow at meter 981225 for the month of march . the hms technician
did contact measurement once to get the volumes zeroed out but apparently he
will have to get with them again . i have notified the tech and he is in the
process of doing this .
the meter is set on pressure control and the valve is open . gas control ' s
understanding and the field ' s understanding is that at the time the
brandywine deal ended some sort of standby agreement was in place . if this
is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the
valve .
robert ,
in the future if you have meters like this where there is a small flow
volume without a nomination in place please check with earl and myself so we
can investigate before we get commercial involved .
thanks

daren ,
i ' m not sure if you are the person that can make this change for me . if you
are not , could you please let me know who i need to speak to .
for meter # 78033 and # 78032 for 3 / 00 production forward , this deal is set
up under the wrong sitara # , therefore the volumes are not pulling in sitara .
the sitara # that it is currently attached to is # 149421 which this deal
was only for 1 / 00 production . the new sitara number that we should be using
is
sitara # 156387 ( for meter # 78033 ) and sitara # 156383 ( for meter # 78032
) . i have attached an example to help see what i am talking about .
( this was for 2 / 00 production )
could you please let me know when the change has been made or if there is
something that i need to do .

jackie :
meter 5688 is incorrectly scheduled to the hpl liquids contract
012 - 41970 - 02 - 002 in march 2000 . also last month when you were out , robert
removed the volume from the liquids contract at this meter and temporarily
put it on a strangers gas contract . if you could fix both months today and
let me know when it is corrected i would appreciate it .

i am new at the 3 rivers allocation so bear with me , i took this over from

meters 5688 and 5801 are not scheduled on the hpl liquids contract
012 - 41970 - 02 - 002 . the contract is currently out of balance by the total
volume at these two meters so if you could fix this by early tomorrow morning
i would appreciate it .

1298,"Subject: re : pg & e texas meeting
recap of pg & e texas meeting 4 / 12 / 00 .
volume issues :
? sherlyn schumack will provide stacey neuweiler with volume variances by day
and contract as soon as possible ( preferably the same day allocation is
received ) .
? stacey will notify sherlyn of correct volume or status if further research
is necessary as soon as possible .
? sherlyn will notify logistics , stacey , and lorraine of pg & e texas of
interconnect variances by day .
? each group will respond promptly to ensure payment can be made through the
system , eliminating manual line items on invoice .
? charlotte hawkins will see what was confirmed on the outstanding
interconnect issue for 2 / 00 , and daren or charlotte will make the necessary
correction .
rate issues :
? heidi withers will pull daily rates from pg & e texas bulletin board .
? greg steagall will provide heidi with service verification ( s ) and the daily
allocation summary received from pg & e texas during close , which shows rates
from pg & e texas .
? no action will be taken on rate variances where pg & e was paid per their
invoice . heidi has talked with brenda herod , and brenda is okay with this
course of action .
? there are four invoices from 1999 production where pg & e was underpaid , so
heidi and greg will work to correct those months to pay pg & e correctly .
there are no open invoices in settlements .
? it was noted that manual line items are not to be used to pay pg & e per
their invoice in the future . we expect to correct issues in the system prior
to the due date of the invoice unless there is a valid disagreement between
ena and pg & e . if ena has a valid disagreement , we will pay per ena  , s
verification .
daren has put in a request for legal to transfer the ena transport contracts
to hpl . this would eliminate stacey having to schedule the transport on ena
as well as the desk to desk deal . it would also prevent sherlyn from having
to allocate the transport expense contract and the brokered desk to desk
deal .
he has not had a response from legal yet .",ham

just to set the record straight , measurement was not contacted nor informed
that the recorded flow was inaccurate . we are dependent on the field to
verify measurement information , and absent information to the contrary , the
recorded volumes were published . the hms technician , charlie speigel , was
contacted today , and this issue was discussed and verified that he
neglected to notify gms of the erroneous recorded flow . we will correct the
statements to reflect zero flow based on this discussion .
